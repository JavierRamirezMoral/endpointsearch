Purpose:
--------
This script is designed to help when handling Azure incidents.
Its goal is to speed up and simplify the search for specific endpoints (e.g., a path like '/myapi' or a hostname like 'api.mydomain.com') across all Application Gateways in all subscriptions of the tenant.
This way, you can quickly identify where an endpoint is configured and act more efficiently for any request or incident.

Main features:
- Uses Azure CLI credentials for authentication.
- Iterates all available subscriptions in the tenant.
- Searches for matches of the provided endpoint in:
    - Path Maps of each Application Gateway.
    - HTTP listeners of each Application Gateway.
    - Request routing rules (`request_routing_rules`), including possible redirects.
- Shows detailed information about where the endpoint was found, including the Application Gateway name, subscription, resource group, Path Map, rule, redirect, or listener.
- Includes a direct link to the resource in the Azure Portal for quick access.
- If the endpoint is not found, it informs the user.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed.
  Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Install the required packages by running:
    pip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-network azure-mgmt-resource
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`).

Usage:
    python endpointSearch.py

The script will prompt for the endpoint to search in the console.

Versions:
    1.0.0 - 2025-05-16 - Script creation.
    1.1.0 - 2025-05-16 - Added direct link to the resource in Azure Portal.
    1.2.0 - 2025-05-16 - Added search in request routing rules (`request_routing_rules`).
